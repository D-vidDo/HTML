        <h1>Courses &amp; Certificates</h1>
        <div id="column">
            <p>During my time at SAIT, I would like to earn certificates that are offered by the institute to increase
                my
                knowledge and understanding on the topics that I want to grasp. I believe earning certificates are
                valuable
                in the workforce and I would want to ensure that I have at least 1 certificate from SAIT before I move
                on
                into a work environment.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Basic 2D Game Design Certificate</h2>
            <p>When I saw that SAIT was offering this certificate, I knew that I wanted to earn it. I am very passionate
                about video games and computers and this certificate specifically really stood out to me. This program
                is
                designed for beginners who would like to learn about the basics of 2D game design&nbsp;[7].</p>

            <h2>Java Development Certificate of Achievement</h2>
            <p>I enjoy coding in Java and earning a certificate of achievement specifically for Java would be very
                valuable
                for me in the future. The Java programming language continues to be one of the most highly demanded
                skills
                in the programming world&nbsp;[8].</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Graphic Design Certificate of Achievement</h2>
            <p>From magazines and billboards to packaging and snowboards, print media is everywhere&nbsp;[9]. In my
                spare
                time, I enjoy messing around and being creative on Adobe Photoshop and creating graphics for various
                things.
                When I saw that SAIT was offering this certificate, I knew that I would want to go for it. I enjoy
                creating
                aesthetically pleasing graphics and the gratification I get when people compliment on how aesthetically
                pleasing something is awesome.</p>

        <h1>Certifications</h1>
        <div id="column">
            <p>Certifications are very valuable in the workforce and I plan on earning at least one of these 3 in the
                near
                future. The Oracle Certified Java Certification, the Android Certified Application Developer, and the
                Amazon
                Web Services Certified Solutions Architect.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Oracle Certified Java Certification</h2>
            <p>This certification is a no-brainer for me considering how I want to be proficient in the Java programming
                language. The journey to get this certification will allow me to learn how to build scalable business
                services that feed dynamic web and mobile applications using Java EE&nbsp;[10].</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <h2>Android Certified Application Developer</h2>
            <p>I spend a lot of time on my phone and would always be curious on how I&rsquo;d make a mobile app. With
                this
                certification, I think I will be one step closer to itching that curiosity. This certification is
                critical
                for [my] Android programming career. It will improve [my] potential in the ever-growing Android market
                and
                move [my] development career forward&nbsp;[11].</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Amazon Web Services Certified Solutions Architect</h2>
            <p>I believe earning a certification for Amazon Web Services would grant passage to so many work
                opportunities
                in the future, and earning this one would be extremely tough. AWS is used in so many things in the
                technology field and being capable of utilizing AWS would be an extremely valuable asset for me. This
                certification will allow me to design available, cost-efficient, fault-tolerant, and scalable
                distributed
                systems on AWS&nbsp;[12].</p>
