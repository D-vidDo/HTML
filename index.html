        <p>
            Hello, my name is David and I am a Software Development major here at SAIT.
            <br><br>
            An interesting fact about me is that I am multi-handed, meaning I can use both my left and right hand to
            accomplish specific tasks. For example, I can only write with my right hand, and I can only throw things
            with my left. Very few people in the world are multi-handed.
            <br><br>
            Another interesting fact about me is my favourite food is lasagna. When I was a kid, I read a lot of
            Garfield comics and watched the Garfield movie a lot and lasagna was Garfield's favourite food. Eventually I
            tried lasagna for the first time and fell in love, just like how Garfield did.
            <br><br>
            A third fact about me is that I enjoy playing video games. My favourite video game at the moment is F1 2019,
            which is a Formula One racing game. I enjoy the thrill of driving at over 300km/h while trying to reach
            first place.<br>
