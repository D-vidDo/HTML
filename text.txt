Who will you talk to and observe?
        We will talk to the cooking students at SAIT,
        as well as any students around campus who enjoy
        cooking.
How will you conduct an observation?
        We will conduct observations by observing the process
        an individual takes to utilize their current ingredients
        to cook up a dish.
What kinds of questions would you ask in an interview?
        - How do you find recipes?
        - Do you usually know what is inside your pantry?
        - Would there be anything that could make finding recipes
        easier for you?
Where would you interview?
        - We can interview in person with various students across campus
        - We can look up online for any criticisms anyone has when it
        comes to finding recipes
How would you "try" the tasks the user does?
        - Based on the interview answers, we can imitate the process
        of finding recipes
            - For example, if the process of finding recipes involves 
            using cookbooks, we will "try" the task by also using a
            cookbook
            - Another example, using google to search for recipes that
            involve ingredients that are in the pantry
What problems do you forsee having? What will be the hardest part of
the process? How will you deal with those?
