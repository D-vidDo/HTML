        <h1>Professional Associations</h1>
        <p>In my academic career, I would eventually like to join and be a part of a growing community in the
            Information Technology field and utilize such resources to better myself and grow as an individual. I have
            selected these three Associations as potential groups to join in the future. CompTIA, The Calgary IT
            Professional User Community, and the Canadian Information Processing Society.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>CompTIA</h2>
        <p>This group interested me as they have various membership plans with varying levels of features that look to
            be very beneficial to anyone who is interested in joining. They have membership levels for all kinds of
            people ranging from students to professionals. CompTIA members are trusted, skilled, and knowledgeable tech
            professionals [4]. I plan to join this group in the summer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Calgary IT Professional User Community</h2>
        <p>I am interested in this community in particular because they always seem to have events going on. I enjoy
            communities that create opportunities for people to connect and bring everyone together to talk about common
            topics and ideas. [They] bring the Calgary IT Pro Community together and liaise with each other, industry
            speakers, and industry leaders to share, respond, and support the IT industry, and professionals, in
            Calgary&nbsp;[5]. I plan to join this group after I graduate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Canadian Information Processing Society</h2>
        <p>This community is very similar to CompTIA in terms of the membership and services that they offer. One
            feature that stood out to me with this community is that they have [m]entoring opportunities to assist [me]
            with [my] current and upcoming career challenges&nbsp;[6]. I thrive when I&rsquo;m taught face-to-face with
            an instructor and I believe this mentorship program will benefit me greatly. I plan to join this group in
            the summer.</p>
